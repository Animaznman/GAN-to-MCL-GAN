# GAN-to-MCL-GAN

This is my attempt at trying out some vanilla GAN, and then working through MCL-GAN.
Working on the toy data of generating a sine-like wave was simple enough. However, working on the MNIST digits data set proved difficult, as the generator often did not converge to producing digits. See the notebook for comments throughout the process.
